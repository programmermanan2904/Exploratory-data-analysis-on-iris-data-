# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Codveda Internship Task 2

## Overview
This project is part of my Data Analytics internship at **Codveda Technology**.  
The task involves **performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset by identifying patterns, trends, and correlations using summary statistics and visualizations.

---

## Objectives
- Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)
- Visualize data distributions using histograms and boxplots
- Create scatter plots to explore relationships between features
- Identify correlations using a heatmap

---

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

---

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded the cleaned dataset from Task 1
2. Computed summary statistics to understand data characteristics
3. Visualized distributions (histograms, boxplots)
4. Plotted scatter plots to analyze feature relationships
5. Generated a correlation heatmap for deeper insights

## Files Included
- `eda_analysis.ipynb` – Google Colab notebook with full EDA process
- `cleaned_dataset.csv` – Dataset used for analysis

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
